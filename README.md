# Living-thing-classification 
Conventional learning algorithms usually treat each feature independently and do not consider the spatial relationships between pixels in an image. This can lead to the loss of important spatial information that is crucial for image understanding. Images are typically represented as high-dimensional feature vectors, with each pixel or region considered a feature. Conventional learning algorithms, such as SVM or logistic regression, may face difficulties in handling high-dimensional data. As the number of features increases, the algorithms may struggle to find meaningful patterns and relationships within the data. The model with best accuracy out of conventional models I tried was Random Classifier for both FINE and COARSE.

Deep learning models can learn increasingly abstract and complex features at different layers of the network. Lower layers of the network learn low-level features such as edges and corners, while higher layers learn more abstract and high-level features such as object shapes and textures. This hierarchical feature learning enables deep learning models to capture intricate patterns and variations present in image datasets.Deep learning models can handle large-scale image datasets with thousands or even millions of images. They are highly scalable, allowing for efficient training on powerful hardware like GPUs or TPUs. I used MoileNetV2 in Fine and Xception in Coarse for Kaggle Submission.

Futhermore, I would like to improve all accuracy as Higher accuracy means that the model is better at recognizing and distinguishing the features and patterns in our images, leading to more accurate predictions. I should use for data augmentation techniques for Deep learningto artificially increase the size of your training dataset and introduce variations in the images.
